This program creates an animation that enables you to play with creating and
destroying 2 objects, named doodads, in Racket.
We can create and destroy objects and watch them bounce off the walls.
We can drag and drop the objects when we pause the animation as well as when animation is live.

Pressing space pauses the animation. Pressing t creates a new star doodad, 
while pressing q creates a new square doodad.

Pressing c changes color of the doodads, while pressing . deletes the most recently created doodads.
