Program Execution Steps

1) run make all in the homework directory
2) Start router with port number 
      E.g ./router 5555
3) Start servers with its port numbers
      E.g. ./server 5789
           ./server 8977
           ./server 3000
           
4) start client providing routers ip:port number as argument
      E.g. ./client 127.0.0.1:5555
      
5) client will be able to create and access key value pairs from servers based on its key values
