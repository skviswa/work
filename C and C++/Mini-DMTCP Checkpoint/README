SINGLE-THREADED CHECKPOINT RESTART PROGRAM

Commands Supported And Purpose

	make check - Build and execute the checkpoint and restart
	make clean - Removes all the binary,object and files generated by the  program



Limitations

	Since the makefile is sending pkill/kill commands, on killing programs "hello and myrestart" 
	make will throw errors like "Makefile:35: recipe for target 'check' failed" and 
	"Makefile:26: recipe for target 'restart' failed". but the program works as expected
