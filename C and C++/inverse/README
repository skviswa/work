A FEW POINTS TO NOTE:
There are two versions, serial and parallel, and timing of both is included as 
a part of the prints.

Since this is for a 1000X1000 matrix inversion, I have not provided any inputs for
changing size. But if it needs to be done, there is a 
#define SIZE macro that can be changed to reflect the size. The default is 1000.

I have included a printMatrix function to print any matrix.
I have also included a sanity check function check to compare results of serial and 
parallel execution.

HOW TO COMPILE THE PROGRAM:
To generate the executable, give make all or make build.
To run the executable, give make run

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE LOGIC:
The logic used is fairly straightforward. LU decomposition with parital pivoting
to factorize the given matrix, then use forward and backward substitution to
produce the inverted matrix.
